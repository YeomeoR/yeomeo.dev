    <!--<p>Hi, I'm Rob. I have a Bachelors degree in Music, I've worked as a classical musician in Glasgow and London and travelled around the world with the finest orchestras, enjoying every minute of it... but I always had a eye on where coding could take me.</p> <br>-->
    <!--    <p>As a classical violinist, playing with the London Symphony Orchestra and co-leader of Royal -->
    <!--        Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, I'm adaptable, responsive, creative and with attention to fine detail.-->
    <!--        Web and software developing has always held a fascination for-->

    <!--        have taken time out of an honours degree course with the Open University in Mathematical Sciences and -->
    <!--        Statistics to enable me to dedicate and structure my time to focus solely on this new career direction in code.-->
    <!--        I'm a hard working consumer of as much information as I can immerse myself in, and always have been. <br>I have a competitive streak that isn't confined to my enjoyment of racing triathlons... But a successful orchestral musician knows, it's teamwork that counts and I could be a valuable member of any team. I'm looking for a company to give me my chance to shine in this new career direction. <br>-->
